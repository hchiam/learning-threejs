# Learning three.js

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Tutorial: <https://discoverthreejs.com>

Note: three.js changes really fast. Check what release number version you're using (also, three.js doesn't use semver). That said, most of the syntax is apparently stable or at least aliased / backwards compatible (check console log for warning messages).
